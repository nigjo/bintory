A lightweight binary repository manager

Goal of this project to create a simple [binary repository manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_repository_manager) based on PHP and no external database. This BRM will just serve static binary files such as executables, shared objects or DLLs in the same way as JARs or any other file. Every file is identified and accessed by a SHA-256 hash created at upload time.

This project is currently in concept phase.
